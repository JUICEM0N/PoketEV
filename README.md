# Poker Algorithm Project

## Introduction
This project is a poker algorithm designed to help users make the highest expected value (EV) decisions, balance their strategies, and calculate the odds of their hand at showdown.

## Features
- Hand evaluation based on precomputed hand strengths
- Monte Carlo simulations for EV calculation
- Strategy balancing using GTO concepts
- Real-time odds calculation

## Installation
